# Sound Button Polymer

Sound button polymer is a web component to play a sound by clicking a button.

### Version
1.0.0

### How to use it

Download a release of polymer-full and extract to your project root directory. Then create your first polymer page (check official polymer documentation on how to do that) but instead of including every single polymer component you need simply add these:

simple button:
```sh
<script src="bower_components/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents-lite.min.js"></script>
<link rel="import" href="boton-element.html">
<boton-element></boton-element>
```

button control element:
```sh
<script src="bower_components/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents-lite.min.js"></script>
<link rel="import" href="boton-control.html">
<boton-control></boton-control>
```

In both cases, you can change the sound to play, replacing the file In_The_End.ogg in the folder  sounds

That's it.
